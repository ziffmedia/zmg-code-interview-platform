# Code Interview Platform

This is browser based vs-code project based off https://github.com/cdr/code-server/ to be used during code based
interviews.  The intention is that the interviewer will have setup a project in a branch of this repository
with a code challenge, lauched this on an EC2 instance, and the interviewee will browse to this project and
do a set of challenges while on a call with the interviewer.

## Branches of Interest:

- `create-react-app-with-jest-enzyme-tests`: this project adds node to the server, has a create-react-app
  project with Jest and Enzyme pre-setup.  This branch will test an interviewee's ability to move around a simple
  project and complete a test of a simple button.
